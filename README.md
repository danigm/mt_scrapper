mt_scrapper
===========

mt_scrapper is a scrapper written in python/Flask for the torrent site mejortorrent.com. It provides an easy way to search, sort and (soon) download the torrent files for your favorite Spanish series.

Please note that this is a very early and bad written version. The code needs to be refactorized and even rewritten, feel free to contribute!
